It was a very bad resort we had to go to close the restaurant because it didn't seem to cook lunch and dinner we were expecting food to be available in this case it didn't start that our village should have fun not because we were still looking for a place to eat out. After that we went to the room as soon as we entered it was obvious that it wasn't being cleaned that time I wanted to go back out in case there was no choice our companions had already paid half because they were there first in the morning we just followed after lunch.

- Pantry area (super convenient since we brought a lot of snacks)
- COMFORTABLE beds (the beds they use are quality. Not cheap and the sheets too are of high quality)
- SPACIOUS (literally lots of room for you to move around, plus the mirror was nice) 
- Free cold/hot water, coffee, and cooking area (commin cooking area but we have solved the problem of cooking breakfast)
- STRATEGIC LOCATION (close to all the GO-TO-SPOTS in Elyu, we just walked all our foot trips because it's right next door. It's also right next to the beach so it's really just a walk trip. It's very economical)

Post,Tim Clemente,2019-10-04,"Stayed last Sept 29 for my wife's bday celebration. We stayed at Bakawan room with balcony. Their resort is a gem in San Juan. Nature is alive with mangroves around the property. If you are a nature lover this is a must in your to-go list. Staffs are welcoming and all smiles. You have a choice if you want to do buffet or ala carte on food. Rooms are basic which is okay, no tv or internet and I personally believe that it should stay that way so people who come here can bond with each other and enjoy the music of nature. They also have a big pool which my son and I enjoyed. too bad it was not harvest time as my son wanted to go fishing. If you are a bird watcher, this place is for you. we actually saw 7 species. Overall I rate this resort  4.5 out of 5. Bakawan rooms could use some renovation as I noticed sockets are not safe for kids and the wood shelf on both sides of the beds. Other than that it was a blast and I would definitely come back with my family here. We now have a new favorite destination in the south.

immediately, we chose to book them for our Team outing. The owner is very helpful, it's like he's ready 24/7 to reply to our inquiries, on, before and even after we checked out at his place, they still guided us. They even let us check in as early as 10:00am (supposed to be 2pm) which
is a really big help to us especially since we're from Santa Rosa, Laguna pa and we had to leave early in Laguna to avoid the traffic. Even gave us links and lists of places where we can
go and visit on our way there so it's really worth it. 

The place is clean and their aircon units are cool, super close to the beach & surf spots so we really enjoyed it.
My family and I have a separate room so we still have privacy even though there are many of us. They also provided offer free mineral water and we had two refills but there was no problem with the owner.

We were all looking forward to a nice place to stay in La Union, then we saw this hostel on IG. Their posts were good so we booked. When you get there you will get EXPECTION vs REALITY!! Their posts are super misleading.

1. BAD ATTITUDE OF THE STAFF. Upon check-in, the receptionist's face was blank. So we gave in because maybe we were just tired. But in our 4D3N stay there, it seems like that attitude is not right anymore. ALL STAFF ACTUALLY! I don't know if that's the only one who is always on purpose, it's like you're too shy to talk to them. Even when asking for the WiFi password, they don't seem to want to give it even when they check in! And until check-out, the attitude of their staff is very disappointing, especially the two receptionists who change every morning and night shift.
2. BEDROOM. Given this is a HOSTEL but it seems like you will be made a spider in a small space! You're barely able to move.
3. WATER. If the water is not EXTREMELY WEAK, they have absolutely NO water. The problem with CR is how it doesn't flush well when you urinate because the water is so weak.
4. COMMON AREAS. You can't hang out in their common area because the fan is broken. It's also hard to hang out in the room because it's so small and you can hardly move.",Accomodation,"TERRIBLE ACCOMMODATION

Post,Elaine Iwa,2023-01-23,"Our Elyu trip was planned only last week of December and one of the reasons why it went ahead is because INN is easy to talk to. Our transaction was smooth. Fortunately, we were accommodated right away because the hotels and transient houses in La Union fill up quickly, especially when there are events.  
For those looking for a place to sleep and stay in Elyu, I recommend INN tayon Elyu. They are 5-7 minutes away from Urbiztondo Beach. The price is affordable and the place is big. You can cook or cook when you are lazy. Actually, they cook well hehe. It's a pity that we only cooked pancit canton yesterday. They also have a mini store where you can buy toiletries and snacks.

Make sure next time, you have enough evidence ready before you tell your guests. It's wrong on our part that we didn't know that the child was forbidden. So we did everything to make him behave.

Post,Karmela BN,2022-06-06,"@shorebreakhostel is a pet-friendly establishment, so it was a no-brainer for us because we wanted to bring not just one, not just two, but THREE dogs!

I think for non-hypoallergenic dogs, you will only have the choice of booking the bunk beds and not the family room. I think It is a fair decision by the hostel. 

I was hesitant at first to share a bathroom with other guests, but it turned out to be okay thanks to the round the clock cleaning by the kind ates. 

There were three toilet stalls and four sinks shared by guests. I do wish they had a full-length mirror at the side of the bathroom, near the entrance. It would be helpful for contacts application (hehe) and outfit checks. 

There were four working individual shower rooms, with changing area. There was one that needed repair work, which I did notsee fixed in our three-day stay. Maybe a point for improvement? 

For the fur-babies, make sure they have diapers if they are not potty-trained. They do have a potty area shared with Billie, their resident golden retriever 

Parking is limited, but there are nearby areas where you can park for a fee. 

No breakfast included in the booking, but there is a dining area with free cold drinking water. You can order coffee, alcohol, and smoothies. You can also drink and eat at the rooftop deck. 

Wifi was okay. It comes and goes in the upper floors, but it was your best bet for internet connection because the phone signal is weak in the area. 

No cleaning of rooms each day, but I think you can get your towels changed per request. 

11:30 am is the checkout time, not the more common 12nn. Be mindful because they charge a fee (our mistake for not reading!). 

The overall aesthetic of the hostel was simple, clean, but still nice to look at. It certainly stands out in the area. The staffs and owner were all so kind and polite 

We loved staying here - super central to the LU hot spots and just a 5-minute walk to the beach. Highly recommend! Go na.",Accomodation,"@shorebreakhostel is a pet-friendly establishment, so it was a no-brainer for us because we wanted to bring not just one, not just two, but THREE dogs!

Room: Very very spacious and has private bath. The view is still beautiful because it is beach front and fresh. The room was clean, spotless! The water flow is also strong and the wifi is fast. 

Host: They're super nice and very accommodating. The stay is so worth it because the transient feels homey, the host is even kinder!

** Plus, you can use their kitchen. They also have utensils, water and refrigerator that you can useù free of charge! You can also get ice in the fridge for free!! 

At first, I was kinda hesitant because they don't have that history on their page even on airbnb. But they're kind enough to acknowledge my legit checking and true enough, they are nice to transact with. I will come back very much and I will recommend it to my other friends who are planning.

Post,Bryna Torres,2019-07-25,"If you are looking for a place to eat after work; school; in Katipunan area, then #TheYardAtTheXavierville is the perfect foodie place for you. It opens late afternoon to midnight; a foodie market feast. #TheYardAtTheXavierville caters numerous cuisines that will not leave you bored or umay from appetizer to dessert and it lives up to the expectation of being The Best foodie night market in the area.

When we got here my boyfriend and I personally chose #RusticBox ; they serve one of the best-tasting, budget-friendly-steak, hot-off-the-grill T-bone and Porterhouse steaks. The place itself is extra ordinary; thus - it is the streak that keeps loyal customers coming back. For just over a hundred bucks, a large piece of well-marinated, adequately-cooked, tender-juicy and aroma-filled steak with a cup of steamed rice is a very good deal, it is getting more than what you pay for. What they do best here is simple; its affordable T-Bone and Porterhouse Steaks, priced range from Php165- Php240 they grill it according to your preference. I must say their prices are truly affordable and their steaks are big. it is always amazing to find affordable places to have your steak fix - deliciously fixed. :) 

#TheYardAtTheXavierville is an open-air eatery along Xavierville Katipunan. We reached the place around 5pm and it is still packed as I post this. Supposed to give 4 stars but #RusticBox 's steaks were so affordable and tasty! So 5 stars it is!

We booked the Condo (2rooms, 3 bathrooms, with balcony, kitchen and dining area).

It is much bigger in actual than the photos! 

We are a group of 7 and still the whole unit is very spacious for all of us!

We were able to cook breakfast in the very cook-ready kitchen (with lpg and complete utensils)!

The unit includes 3 split-type aircons, 2 in the bedrooms and 1 in the dining area as well. 

Wifi is very reliable inside the Casa ~ unlike going outside wherein the cellular data is very weak in some areas. 

Their huge garage can hold up to 8 cars or more I think! For Car users you can easily drive to the beach/restaurant areas only within 5 mins or just ride a local tricycle. 

Most of all the owner Mrs. Ana is very accommodating and thoughtful!

Post,Cyndie Lopez,2019-07-30,"My family and I went to this resort on July 28, 2019 and I don't recommend this place because;
1. The breakfast has no taste. As far as I know, salt is cheap.  We chose bangus with egg and rice. As for the egg, I only cooked 3 pcs and divided it for the six of us.  Hopefully, I told them to cook it sunny side up. And take note, it's not a free breakfast. I paid for it. 125/person. The coffee, very strong, no extra sugar. And the staff is also lazy. It's good that we have enough food to last until morning. But, we are super hungry.

2. CR is dirty. Lots of soap stains on the tiles. At least, fix the cleaning. We booked 2 rooms. One room comes with soap and shampoo, which is great. But the other one, nothing. The towels in one room, fragrant, look like new laundry. But the other one, smelled from the trunk. 

3. Your big pool, set, 5ft minimum. But in reality, he is 7ft.  Woe to those who can't swim. Just to the side.  Of course we don't want to go to the kiddie pool. It's dirty. 

4. I didn't see a lifeguard. Swim at your own risk.
I gave them the benefit of the doubt that maybe the negative reviews about the resort are outdated. We said maybe it has improved. Case, it's the same. No improvements, based on past reviews. It's like a resort. In management, I hope you can see the reviews. From 2019 until now, same comments about your place.

Post,Tim Clemente,2019-10-04,"Stayed last Sept 29 for my wife's bday celebration. We stayed at Bakawan room with balcony. Their resort is a gem in San Juan. Nature is alive with mangroves around the property. If you are a nature lover this is a must in your to-go list. Staffs are welcoming and all smiles. You have a choice if you want to do buffet or ala carte on food. Rooms are basic which is okay, no tv or internet and I personally believe that it should stay that way so people who come here can bond with each other and enjoy the music of nature. They also have a big pool which my son and I enjoyed. too bad it was not harvest time as my son wanted to go fishing. If you are a bird watcher, this place is for you. we actually saw 7 species. Overall I rate this resort  4.5 out of 5. Bakawan rooms could use some renovation as I noticed sockets are not safe for kids and the wood shelf on both sides of the beds. Other than that it was a blast and I would definitely come back with my family here. We now have a new favorite destination in the south.

Post,Riz Estrella - Pendon,2019-05-28,"What I like:
- Easy to find, itÆs just along the highway. 
- Has their own parking & itÆs big. Can fit around 20 cars I guess or more. Unlike the other resorts, you park your car along the highway at your own risk. 
- Near the food hubs and restaurants. 
- Very nice staffs, both the resort and bar staffs. 
- Though we didnÆt order at the Blue but itÆs a nice place to chill. 
- Affordable. 



Additional feedback/commendation:
We arrived waaaaay early than our check-in time. We requested for early check-in via our Agoda reservation & they responded that itÆs subject to availability which is okay. They offered to place our stuff in the reception area while we chill at the Blue or by the shore. 
Guests from our room checked out past 12 and Kuya Val immediately asked the staff to clean it. He even showed us upstairs, helped bring our stuff & was very welcomy as if he is touring us in his own house. 
While waiting by the reception area, I heard some of the guests were already repeat guests or have been there before. Most of them are foreigners & were very comfortable in talking to the staffs. The staffs in return were very cheerful and hospitable. 
I guess itÆs one of the reasons why guests keep on going back to Little Surfmaid. Yes, beach area is not that good and facility needs improvement but since they have great, cheerful and hospital staffs, then I wouldnÆt mind. ? will definitely recommend.",Accomodation,"What I like:

Post,Bianca Reyes,2023-03-20,"The transient house is nice, just 5 minutes from the beach. just walk, the owner is not very accommodating, when you enter the room there is no electric fan in the living room itself and there is no TV, you have to open the two rooms to let the air conditioner cool in the living room because there is no electric fan. Ung a room with weak air conditioning. When we tried to adjust the air conditioner and we showed the owner how to adjust it, did the owner say ""I already fixed it?

Post,Miko Calayan,2019-08-31,"I have stayed in a couple of places in LU and almost all the hostels. No doubt this is the best. Stayed in this place for 5 days, i had a really awesome experience. 

The location is great. A short walk to the restaurants, highway and beach. Staff was impressive. They were very accommodating and friendly. Their service was really good! I never for once in the whole week see them frown or not smile. All my concerns were always met and they were always happy to help guests with their concerns. I also would like to mention the owners of the hostel, Buji and Nikki. In my experience they are the nicest and best hosts in a hostel. They are very humble and wonderful hosts. 

You will never really feel crowded in this hostel since there are 22 beds overall. I like hostels like this since usually service is better at this number. The rooms are really nice. Its not a basic room. Its simple yet well designed rooms. Sometimes i really feel like i just want to hang out in the room because it's very cozy inside. There are a lot of space for people in the room to put their things. Rooms are all equipped with A/C, perfect for the Philippines as it could be very warm sometimes. Towels and blankets that were provided smelled really good and were clean. All the common areas, toilets, and showers were ALWAYS clean. Also all the tissues, and Body wash were always filled. The hostel also provide an outdoor shower for people coming from the beach or from people coming from surfing. Also a surf rack if guests do bring their boards.

Lastly would like to mention the Roof deck. I love hanging out in that place. It's very chill to hang out there. Great place to meet other guests in the hostel! Oh and there is a Kitchen and Fridge in the roof deck for guests who would want to cook their own food or put some stuff on the fridge. It is also a great place to study and work. There were a couple of guests that i met who were there working in the roof deck.

Post,Ken Tivará,2024-01-16,"Been to Elyu several times but this is the first time we tried a different accommodation, and seriously - one of the best decisions we made while in Elyu.

Their place is a paradise not more than 5mins from the main road but still very peaceful esp at night, talk about perfect location! It was a spontaneous trip coming from Manila, and I was able to book a tent for an overnight stay instantly. Arrived at 8pm and staff weÆre very accommodating, they set up my tent, table and chairs by the beach ù expect musical ocean waves perfect for the soul. I booked for 2 more nights in their air-conditioned kubo ù a very comfortable kubo with a big-ass bed that can fit upto 4 pax and a dining / sala outside your room where you can eat, drink and just basically chill. LetÆs talk about food ù definitely a bang for the buck! From their silog meals to snacks to their ala-carte dishes. The ateÆs are always there to assist you with your order and deliver it to your cabin, def a great service! They are very friendly too! Facility wise, pools are I think cleaned everyday because ive been swimming day and night and water is always clear. There is an open-area where you can charge your gadgets if youÆll avail their tent accommodation. Restroom and Bathroom are common but seperate for male and female are always cleaned by their staff, I am very particular for TandB but was able to use their facilities perfectly fine. The resort staff was one of the most friendliest people IÆve ever met, even compared to 3-5 stars hotels and resorts ive been. They always check on me knowing I traveled alone and cater to things I need. I will definitely go back to oceanaire, not just for the view and facilities which is perfect but more for the staff. If you want to re-charge your soul, this is the perfect place for you. Thank you ateÆs and kuya for making me feel safe and at home.

Arrived at 8pm and staff weÆre very accommodating, they set up my tent, table and chairs by the beach ù expect musical ocean waves perfect for the soul. I booked for 2 more nights in their air-conditioned kubo ù a very comfortable kubo with a big-ass bed that can fit upto 4 pax and a dining / living room outside your room where you can eat, drink and just basically chill. LetÆs talk about food ù definitely a bang for the buck! From their silog meals to snacks to their ala-carte dishes. The waiters are always there to assist you with your order and deliver it to your cabin, def a great service! They are very friendly too! Facility wise, pools are I think cleaned everyday because ive been swimming day and night and water is always clear. There is an open-area where you can charge your gadgets if youÆll avail their tent accommodation. Restroom and Bathroom are common but separate for male and female are always cleaned by their staff, I am very particular for TandB but was able to use their facilities perfectly fine. The resort staff was one of the friendliest people I've ever met, even compared to 3-5 stars hotels and resorts I've been. They always check on me knowing I traveled alone and cater to things I need. I will definitely go back to oceanaire, not just for the view and facilities which are perfect but more for the staff. If you want to recharge your soul, this is the perfect place for you.

P1,390 ang rate nila sa bawat Single Bed,pero ginawang 1,190 per single Bed ang ginamit namin tatlong Bed lang,sinisingil kami ng 4 na Bed pati Breakfast, eh hindi namn kami ngbreakfast at tatlo lang ang ginamit namin na Bed,
Staff walang kwenta, ibang-iba sa mga Resort na Napuntahan namin,
Ung isang Owner na lalaki Saludo kami sayo Sir napaka-approchable mo dahil sayo kaya kami nag-Stay dyan sa Urbiz.

Their rate is P1,390 for each single bed, but they changed it to 1,190 per single bed as we only used three beds, they charged us for 4 beds including breakfast, well we didn't have breakfast and we only used three beds,
Staff useless, very different from the Resorts We've Been to,
A male Owner, we salute you Sir, you are very approachable because of you, that's why we stayed there at Urbiz.
But looking back, La Union has more and better Beach Resorts and kind owners and kind Staff.
Im Sorrry, the place is beautiful and Relaxing when we go to La Union, this Urbiz Garden is the one we go to because the Ambience is really Relaxing.

Post,Kit Gladstone,2024-04-07,"The staffs are friendly and very accommodating. The food serving is decent and reasonable for its price. 

However, upon booking we originally asked for a queen sized bed and a bunk bed so after we made a down payment they told us that the room we asked for is unavailable and the available room is only two bunk beds so good thing IÆm traveling with friends so we can just adjust. I just could not imagine if someone travels with family, a partner and kids perhaps. The room that we got only had two outlets for charging and It is located at the upper bunk bed which is not well thought out electrical planning. The WiFi inside our room is weak and is only accessible outside our door so you if youÆre planning to rest all day while binge watching a show on YouTube or Netflix it wouldnÆt be possible. In our case, my friend works as a VA and the other one is also a student who have to do some important meetings and we have to stay in their restaurant/breakfast area so we can connect to a stronger internet connection. There was an unannounced power outage during our stay and it so happened in the midst of us eating dinner. We were in a middle of a boodle fight and we were provided by a candle light. They donÆt have an electric generator for a back up in case unexpected things like this happen. We went outside to look for cafeÆs since my friend still has to start her shift in a few hours and good thing the power came back just before she clocked in at work.

We were there with my friends and were just few minutes in after check-in last 8-9 April 2023 when the owner entered our room and told us to COUNT-OFF. As a guest/tourist, instead of hearing WELCOME TO QUERENCIA. you were instructed to count-off. She continued her tirade on us and one by one she told us their rules, which I think we already know even before we get there. We do not know her reasons on why she acted like that. WE DID NOT EXPECTED THIS FROM LA UNION. Ilocanos are friendly/welcoming as I have friends who came from this region in the Philippines. We just hope that our experience from this place will be the last and hopefully will not be repeated to their guests in the future.

She continued her tirade on us and one by one she told us their rules, which I think we already know even before we get there. We do not know her reasons on why she acted like that. WE DID NOT EXPECT THIS FROM LA UNION. Ilocanos are friendly/welcoming as I have friends who came from this region in the Philippines. We just hope that our experience from this place will be the last and hopefully will not be repeated to their guests in the future.
P.S. The restrooms have no exhaust nor small window for air to circulate or expel off bad odor (bio). Where else will this bad odor go? - Inside the room. ????

Post,Adrian MacGoey,2019-01-03,"OUTSTANDING! Everything about Gefseis Greek Grill was fantastic.

We sent a message through Facebook to inquire if we could bring our small dog with us for a late lunch and the message was answered immediately - thank you!

The setting for the restaurant was fabulous, great decor and pleasant staff dressed in authentic Greek uniforms. The staff were knowledgeable and informative and the food was delicious, so much so in fact we ordered more for take out. We had 3 different styles of pita dips, all very tasty and fresh, the tuna steak was perfectly cooked, the chicken kebab was excellent and the grilled lamb rack was to die for.

The ambience was tranquil and the setting was breathtaking, watching the waves crashing in on the beach behind and the surfers doing their thing. The only thing I would note is the staff, although pleasant, could be a little friendlier.

Post,Maria Nicole Reyes Pavon,2023-05-02,"I had a bad experience yesterday, I was so craving for coffee and grilled cheese. So me and my family go there so that I can have my favorite breakfast there I visited El union coffee 4 years ago and I always love the way they treat customers and how good they're food taste, I'm very excited going I wake up around 8am and I hurry going to the establishment cause I know they always have a line, but I'm with my mom so I don't need to fall in line cause she is a pwd plus she also craves for it. So I go infront and asking if do you still honor pwds cause it was a long time ago so I wanna know before I fall in line so that i know if I do still need to fall in line, the guy that I asked was very accommodating he is wearing white shirt and he has a white hair color like a blonde one he was kind and very welcoming but the personnel who takes orders and money is very not welcoming!!! I was so mad cause I worked in hospitality industry and I never approached my customers the way he did like he was not screaming to the question but his eyes and his body language speaks alot. And I can do tell cause the people around me in the counter was also afraid or maybe pissed off but they don't show it cause they just want the food like me, the cashier employee to make it more precise I think he is gay so that you can recognize him because I see him fixing the pride flag at the counter the rainbow flag that represents LGBT community, then they gave me my coffee and it was okay but I forgot the lid and I DONT WANT TO COME BACK ANYMORE I told my mom to get a lid for me and this gay employee said your daughter didn't requested for a lid so we didn't give her if you want a lid it costs 10 peso my mom bought a lid cause I need it. It was such a terrible experience, one thing I learned about business is that your loyal customer is a walking advertisement and she having a bad experience and it will be remembered for a lifetime so it's either you fix it or you just ignore. It's either you maintain or improve your business. I hope this means a lot cause I don't want someone to experience what I have experienced yesterday and I will SURELY NOT COME BACK ANYMORE EVEN THE FOOD IS TO DIE FOR, I'd rather look for a new and unestablished coffee shop that wants my money and presence than a very known coffee shop but the employees doesn't value its own customers, doesn't know work ethics and don't even respects the people around them so sad for this business, Enjoy it while it lasts nothing lasts forever if you don't know how to manage people.",Food,"I had a bad experience yesterday, I was so craving for coffee and grilled cheese.

However, upon booking we originally asked for a queen sized bed and a bunk bed so after we made a down payment they told us that the room we asked for is unavailable and the available room is only two bunk beds so good thing IÆm traveling with friends so we can just adjust. I just could not imagine if someone travels with family, a partner and kids perhaps. The room that we got only had two outlets for charging and It is located at the upper bunk bed which is not well thought out electrical planning.

In our case, my friend works as a VA and the other one is also a student who have to do some important meetings and we have to stay in their restaurant/breakfast area so we can connect to a stronger internet connection. There was an unannounced power outage during our stay and it so happened in the midst of us eating dinner. We were in a middle of a boodle fight and we were provided by a candle light. They donÆt have an electric generator for a back up in case unexpected things like this happen. We went outside to look for cafeÆs since my friend still has to start her shift in a few hours and good thing the power came back just before she clocked in at work.
