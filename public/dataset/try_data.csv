Post,Tin Olivar,07/05/2024,"Thank u Balai Tino for accommodating us into your beautiful home. The place is so organized, neat, safe and convenient to our needs. Booking process was hassle free and the caretaker, Kuya Alfred, was so helpful to all of our request. We also appreciate the host’s effort of securing a generator prior to our arrival due to unstable power supply in San Juan. It only shows that they really prioritize the comfort of their guest!",Accommodation

Tweet,Hywin Tiu ,06/05/2024,We stayed here with some friends about a week ago. It's the perfect place to bond and relax! The owners are very friendly and accommodating. The best part of the stay is the awesome ambience of the beach and how clean it is. Having a bonfire was a blast while enjoying the sounds of the waves and the crackling of the fire. Highly recommended! ,Accommodation
Tweet,Coffee Rumble,03/03/2024,booked a fan bali hut through Mam Ruby. for 2k mura na sya. as in a minute away from the beach lang sya. during night time sobrang lamig kaya di na need ang aircon. not recco lang sa mga digital nomads since di nga aircon and mainit kapag daytime talaga. all in all we enjoyed our stay here.,Activities

Tweet,Jenny Domingo,06/05/2024,We really enjoyed our stay here. Room is aesthetically pleasing. Mabango and malinis. Accesible din yung place since sa may highway lang siya. Tricycle service is available 24/7. Then tawid lang ng daan and konting asa dagat kana. Value for money!,Experience
